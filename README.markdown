Quick n Dirty Resume App!
=========================

This is just a fun little quickie app that does very little except render a page in sinatra, passing in
some hardcoded values from the model into the html5 haml view. In a perfect world these would be
drawn from the database. This would be easy to add in the future, but for now I'm keeping it simple.

Feel free to stalk about the resume's commits. Although I don't have any grand plans for this app, I
still decided to keep master distinct from my personal branch. Master has only filler text but all the
structure and styling. My personal branch has no changes from master except for the text in the controller.

If you'd like to grill me on some of my choices in this app feel free, as I always enjoy a debate, though
keep in mind this is by no means a production app ;P
